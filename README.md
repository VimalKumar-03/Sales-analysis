# 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover business insights.
It includes data cleaning, exploration, and visual analysis to identify revenue trends, top-performing products, and seasonal sales patterns.

# 🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw sales data.
Identify top-selling products and categories.
Analyze monthly and regional revenue patterns.
Visualize trends and performance metrics using charts.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas and NumPy — for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn — for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook


# ⚙️ Process
# 🔹 1. Data Collection
Gathered raw sales data from the provided CSV file (sales_data_raw.csv).
Checked the structure — columns like order_date, product_name, revenue, state, etc.

# 🔹 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Checked for missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
Handled nulls using suitable imputation or removal.
Converted order_date into a datetime format.
Created new columns like order_month for monthly analysis.
Saved the cleaned data as sales_data_cleaned.csv.

# 🔹 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Calculated total revenue, average order value, and product-wise performance.
Grouped and analyzed sales by:
Product
Region/State
Month
Identified top-performing products and regions.

# 🔹 4. Data Visualization
Created clear and meaningful charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
Bar charts → Top 10 products by revenue
Line plot → Monthly revenue trends
Heatmap → Correlation between numeric features
Pie chart → Regional revenue distribution

# 🔹 5. Insights & Interpretation
Highlighted which products and regions contribute most to sales.
Identified seasonal spikes in revenue.
Found low-performing areas that may need marketing or pricing focus.

# 🔹 6. Conclusion
Provided actionable insights to improve business decisions.
Suggested focusing on high-revenue products and optimizing low-performing areas.

# 🔹 7. Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.
